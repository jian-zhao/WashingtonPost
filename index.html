            </h2>
            <p class="writting">
              Beyond his executive order to make it easier to buy a long-disputed type of health insurance with fewer benefits and weaker government protections, the president has been personally involved in undercutting the system. Many nonpartisan experts believe that these active measures are likely to undermine the pillars of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and hasten the collapse of insurance marketplaces.

              It's abundantly clear the president is thirsty for a win. It has been 10 months since his first day in office —the day he promised to sign a law repealing and replacing his predecessor’s signature health-care law.

              The president is “decertifying” the nuclear accord brokered by Barack Obama, charging that Tehran is “not living up to the spirit of the deal.” He said if Congress, U.S. allies and his administration cannot come up with way to strengthen the agreement, “it will be terminated.”
